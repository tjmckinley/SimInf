##' Specify the number of threads that SimInf should use
##'
##' Set number of threads to be used in SimInf functions that are
##' parallelized with OpenMP (if available). If OpenMP is available,
##' SimInf uses the 'omp_get_num_procs()' function and the
##' environmental variables 'OMP_THREAD_LIMIT', 'OMP_NUM_THREADS', and
##' 'SIMINF_NUM_THREADS' to determine the maximum number of threads to
##' use in functions that are parallelized. Additionally, the maximum
##' number of threads can be controlled by the 'threads' argument.
##' @param threads integer with maximum number of threads to use in
##'     functions that are parallelized with OpenMP (if
##'     available). Default is NULL, i.e. to use all available
##'     processors and then check for limits in the environment
##'     varibles.
##' @return Integer with the maximum number of threads that will be
##'     used.
