\title{Specify the number of threads that SimInf should use}
\usage{
set_num_threads(threads = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{threads}{integer with maximum number of threads to use in
functions that are parallelized with OpenMP (if
available). Default is NULL, i.e. to use all available
processors and then check for limits in the environment
varibles.}
}
\value{
Integer with the maximum number of threads that will be
    used.
}
\description{
Set number of threads to be used in SimInf functions that are
parallelized with OpenMP (if available). If OpenMP is available,
SimInf uses the 'omp_get_num_procs()' function and the
environmental variables 'OMP_THREAD_LIMIT', 'OMP_NUM_THREADS', and
'SIMINF_NUM_THREADS' to determine the maximum number of threads to
use in functions that are parallelized. Additionally, the maximum
number of threads can be controlled by the 'threads' argument.
